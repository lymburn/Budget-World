App Store Link: https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/budget-world/id1394895650

Budget World is an income/expense tracking app to allow for simple budgeting. This app was more complex as I included many more features
such as charts, transactions tracking, recurring transactions, and savings. It provided me with a way to learn Core Data and work
on a larger app with more views and data management.  

Key Features:  
• Track monthly balances from incomes and expenses  
• Ability to add recurring transactions that operate on a daily basis  
• Listing of transactions in a table along with the category, date, and amount  
• Ability to create saving plans and deposit money into them  
• Line and pie charts showing balance over a month and expenses respectively  
• Real-time currency conversions with Fixer API (personal use, not released available for App Store version)  

Skills Practiced:  
• Practiced the fundamentals of Core Data such as storing, deleting, and querying  
• Practiced API calls and JSON parsing (Fixer API)  
• Further practiced creating UI from code and autolayout  
• Learned how to use the iOS Charts library  
• Worked heavily with date handling  
• More practice with UIKit
